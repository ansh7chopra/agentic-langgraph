🧠 Intelligent Chatbot with LangGraph, LangChain, and Groq LLM
This project is a backend chatbot built using Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb) and powered by advanced LLM tools and agent-based reasoning. It uses LangGraph, LangChain, and Groq API for natural language understanding and task execution. The chatbot also integrates external tools such as Tavily for web search and includes custom tool integration, agent memory, and a ReAct agent architecture.

🚀 Features
💬 Conversational Agent: ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) architecture for intelligent interaction.

🧠 Memory Integration: LLM memory for context-aware conversations.

🔗 LangChain + LangGraph: Structured prompt and flow management.

⚡ Groq LLM API: Fast and efficient language processing.

🌐 Tavily Tool: Integrated web search for real-time information.

🛠️ Custom Tool: A user-defined tool to multiply two numbers via the chatbot.

📓 Built in Jupyter Notebooks: Clean and modular development workflow.
